    <h1>What to Expect as a Caregiver or Loved One</h1>
    <p>Keep an eye out for ways you can help your person with ALS (or PALS) adjust to the changes that are occuring. Even the smallest ways you can help can make a  difference. You might also want to watch for how ALS symptoms change. No, you don’t have to stare at your family member with ALS, but just notice when things change. Then let your mom or dad know and they will tell the doctor. That way the doctor may be able to treat the symptoms and prepare you for upcoming changes. </p>
	<h2>How might things change?</h2>
    <p>People with ALS will lose the ability to do a lot of things, including getting out of bed, moving onto a chair, getting dressed, showering, eating, and toileting. This is due to the loss of the motor neurons causing paralysis. Also, people living with ALS lose muscle mass and, as a result, lose body weight. Weight loss is also due in part to increased need for calories, decreased ability to eat adequately because of swallowing difficulties, as well as arm and hand weakness, which impacts the ability to feed oneself.</p>
	<h2>Is it okay to talk about it?</h2>
    <p>Medical practitioners are not allowed to discuss another persons medical history because of HIPA laws. As family members or friends, there are no such laws holding you back from dicussing this information. It may make the most sense for you to not talk about how your loved one has ALS. However, it has proven to be beneficial for most loved ones to discuss their situation with others. In fact, it can be very helpful to talk to a coach, a teacher, or a mentor. Sometimes this is an ideal solution because these adults are removed from the immediate situation, but they are still available to lend a listening ear to let you talk things out.</p>
	<p>Talking about ALS with your own friends and family can allow you to take ownership of ALS in your life. By telling your story, you can help your peers better understand ALS and how it can impact families. You have the power share as much information - or as little – as you feel comfortable. By getting out ahead of any questions they may have or gossip about your PALS – you get to start the conversation.</p>
	<p>Some find it even more useful to not just talk about how ALS is influencing their life, but also by bringing awareness to ALS. Some people bring awareness by participating in Walks for ALS or even founding their own local walk if one does not exist yet. Others have made bake sales to raise money and awareness (and maybe even to show off cooking skills). There have also been sporting events or tournaments held to help raise awareness and support for PALS! Giving a presentation, creating a fundraiser, and raising awareness can be a lot of fun and a great way to engage the school, your peers, and your whole community. As a side benefit – it can also bring together families!</p>
	<p>It's important to remember that it's okay if you aren’t comfortable talking to teachers or school staff right away. In fact, many teens and loved ones say they would never just go and talk to a teacher or other person about something so personal. That's alright! You get to chose who gets to know about how ALS influences your life. If this sounds like you – write down a list of reasons or thoughts about why you aren’t ready to talk about it. Go back to the list after a few days or weeks and see if things have changed. You never know how things might change!</p>
	<h2>What does it mean to be a caregiver?</h2>
	<p>A caregiver is any person who helps or assists a PALS in daily life. Family members, friends, loved ones and more can be considered caregivers to a PALS. Some typical caregiver activities inclues but are not limited to helping someone get dressed, move around, bathe, eat, or drink. Smaller things that help out a PALS from day to day can include just cleaning the house, doing the dishes, or taking out the trash. Being a caregiver really just means that you are doing something to help or take care of another person Remember, any help for another can go a long ways! </p>
	<p>Here is a list of the things kids told us they do to care for a family member with ALS:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Setting up, managing, and supporting communication devices</li>
	  <li>Talking to the doctor for the family member living with ALS</li>
	  <li>Assisting with preparing food and feeding the person living with ALS</li>
	  <li>Tracking and administering medication</li>
	  <li>Cleaning and manging respiratory equipment</li>
	  <li>Engaging with range of motion exercises with the PALS</li>
	  <li>Cleaning drool and helping with oral hygiene</li>
	  <li>Transferring and bathing</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Just like talking about ALS in general, it can be difficult to talk about something like bathing or feeding your parent with other kids. Caregiving is one of those topics that people don’t share – even adults! Even though it may seem embarrassing to do this, talk to your parents about youth programming through The ALS Association. If there is one place where other kids will “get it” – it is there. You are not alone in being a caregiver. While most of your friends at school may not get it – the kids who participate in youth programming and services from The ALS Association will.</p>
	<h2>"Sometimes I just want to be heard"</h2>
	<p>We are human, and we like to be told that what we do is good, or helpful. This includes being a caregiver. Kids tell us all the time how people ask about their mom or dad, their grandparent or loved one, but rarely about them. It is nice to be asked, and you should not feel bad about wanting to be acknowledged. One teenager said, “I just feel kind of like always helping other people, and no one’s there to help me, I guess. That would be the best thing is just kind of have someone go, hey, good job, whatever. You know, sometimes.” This is a very normal feeling.</p>
	<h2>But how do I talk about being a caregiver?</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Be honest</b> - It's okay to say how you feel about caregiving. Chances are your family member is a bit uncomfortable as well.</li>
		<li><b>Without anger</b> - This is important. You may be really upset, sad, or angry about it, but when you use anger it shuts everyone down. Think about how you feel, maybe write it down, then talk about it with a trusted adult or friend. They may be able to help you find a way to discuss caregiving without getting upset</li>
		<li><b>Humor</b> - Sometimes you just have to laugh – even when it seems like what you are laughing at is not that funny. Laughter can make a situation easier and can make people less worried or upset.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>When someone dies: grief and loss</h1>
	<p>This is a tough topic. We don’t know many people who like to talk about this subject. Most people run far from it. But what we know is how important it is to talk about loss and express your feelings, because this can be a really difficult time. You and your family deserve to talk about how things are changing, what the loss of your family member will look like, and what do you do after they are gone. Pushing these feeling down can only make things worse – sometimes many years later. So, having honest open conversation now is so important.</p>
	<h2>Grief is normal</h2>
	<p>The sadness of losing a family member does not just go away. It takes time, and during this time you will miss them in your own way. You do not ever “get over” a person’s death, but you can learn to live with the reality. Grief is not a problem we are trying to fix. It’s an experience you live with. A 16-year-old talks about how her mom died when she was 10 years old, but that even now — six years later — she misses her and cries sometimes. This is totally normal. Just like your family adapted to having ALS – the “new normal” — you are now adapting to the loss of that family member. Another “new normal.” Take the time to work through it and always, always talk to someone about it.</p>
	<h2>Your grief is yours and may be very different from someone else's</h2>
	<p>Just like your relationship with the person with ALS was different than anyone else’s, so is the way you feel after they die. Some people have a need to talk about the person who died and their feelings. This is perfectly fine. You can always talk about them – forever. Others might not talk about the person at all. Others might express their grief through art, play, music, or writing. How you grieve is personal and unique to you.</p>
	<h2>Grieving alone can make you feel alone</h2>
	<p>Sometimes people avoid talking about the person who died for fear that doing so will make you feel worse. But, if they do this, it may make you feel as though talking about, or even expressing your grief, is not acceptable. Some may feel like they are the only person who has experienced the death of someone in their life, even though there might be other friends experiencing similar circumstances.</p>
	<h2>You experience grief differently throughout your life</h2>
	<p>Many times, intense feelings of grief will last longer and come more often than we think they should. Grief is a lifelong experience. You will experience grief on different levels and at different times throughout your lives. When you get your driver’s license, score a touchdown, go to prom, or graduate from high school, you might think about that person you lost in very intense way. This extends into adulthood as well. Grief has no time limit. Sharing your feelings openly can help to normalize this experience and help you find ways to deal with these powerful feelings that will come and go — and come back again throughout your life.</p>
	<h2>Grief can be positive and help you grow</h2>
	<p>You may not feel it now, but it can happen. Going through really, really tough times can make us grow as people. It does not take away from the sadness, grief, and loss, and it does not mean the loss was a good thing. But, going through this may make you feel more compassionate toward others and even value the importance of good friends in a way you did not before.</p>
