    <h1>What is ALS?</h1>
	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.</p>
    <p>ALS is sometimes called “motor neuron disease,” or MND. However, this term, MND, is used less often because there are other causes of MND besides ALS. ALS is a type of Motor Neuron Disease (MND). MNDs are diseases that damage the motor nerve cells, which are cells required for movement. Amyotrophic is a medical term meaning loss of nutrition to the muscle. Muscles lose their bulk and get smaller. The term sclerosis means scarring or hardening. In ALS, this scarring is due to the damage and loss of nerve cells. Lateral means the side and refers to the area of the spinal cord that houses the fibers of the nerve cells that die off in ALS.</p>
	<h2>What does ALS do?</h2>
	<p>ALS causes weakness and wasting of all voluntary muscles. This means that the muscles we use to move, swallow, and even breathe, become affected by ALS. All body movements require nerve cells in the brain and in the spinal cord. These nerve cells are called motor neurons and they control our muscles. The brain sends signals to the appropriate nerve cells in the spinal cord that control the muscles in the arms, legs, and feet, for example, to perform actions such as picking up a glass or moving a foot. These cells send messages to the muscles via a long nerve fiber called an axon. Without this signal, there is no way for a muscle to know what to do. It is similar to computer keyboards: if they are not plugged in, there is no connection and the computer screen remains blank. The muscle also needs this nerve connection to survive.</p>
	<p>There is a symbiotic relationship (that means they need each other) between every muscle in our body and a specific nerve axon. If the connection is severed, not only will the muscle not get the signal of what to do, it also will shrink (medical term: atrophy) without an axon (Figure 1). This is why, in ALS or other MNDs, we cannot stimulate the nerve artificially to reverse the effects of the disease: the axon must be intact for the muscle to remain healthy.</p>
	<p>The disease can start in different places in the body. However, as time progresses, the weakness worsens in the muscles that were affected first and then spreads to other parts of the body.</p>
    <h2>What Causes ALS?</h2>
    <p>ALS most often occurs sporadically, meaning without a known cause or warning. There is no known direct cause. That means we can’t say if it has to do with what you eat, how you exercise, or the air you breathe. But, there is a lot of research being done to figure out what factors in the environment may influence how someone develops ALS.</p> 
	<p>Sporadic ALS is responsible for approximately 90 percent of all cases of ALS diagnosed. Sporadic means the disease is not passed down in families. Researchers are looking for genes that may make one person more likely than another to develop ALS.</p>
	<p>There is a small group of people with a genetic form of ALS, referred to as familial ALS or fALS. This makes up approximately 10 percent of people with ALS, and it has a high presence in the family (medical term: penetrance). This means that many family members are affected by it (such as parents, siblings, or grandparents; but not typically a second or third cousin, or remote family member). However, if you have concerns about a family connection, you should speak to your physician or health care provider to discuss the potential of developing fALS and any recommended genetic testing.</p>
	<h2>How does ALS get worse?</h2>
	<p>This is a tough one to answer, since no two people experience ALS exactly the same. Some people have it worse and decline in one area before it spreads, while others have a rapid progression throughout their body. In some people, the disease progresses very slowly.</p>
	<h2>How long does someone live with ALS</h2>
	<p>In general, people with ALS live about three to five years after they experience the first symptoms appear. This is a generalization, which is based on averages. People with ALS can live anywhere from a few months to decades depending upon disease changes and the types of medical care and assistive devices they choose. Some even believe that the persons attitude also influences their progression. ALS is different in each person and will run an individual course.</p>
	<h2> Is there a cure?</h2>
	<p>Unfortunately, there is no cure for ALS. There is no known way to stop or reverse this disease. There are, however, treatments that ALS specialists recommend to help people manage their symptoms. There are also many researchers and research groups actively trying to find ways to slow the progression of ALS and find the causes of ALS.</p>
