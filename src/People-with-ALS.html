    <h2>What to Expect as a Person with ALS</h2>
	<p>Receiving a diagnosis of ALS is challenging and overwhelming. There is so much to know, a great deal to consider, and typically a host of questions. While no two people with ALS are alike or will experience the condition the same way, there is a great deal of collective knowledge and wisdom available from health care providers, people with ALS, family members and caregivers.</p>
	<p>Being diagnosed with ALS can seem overwhelming. It is completely natural to feel shocked, scared, sad, angry, and a long list of other emotions. Along with those emotions, you must take steps to deal with the diagnosis and begin living life with ALS. But what should you do, and where should you start?</p>
	<p>If you haven’t already done so, it’s always a good idea to get a second opinion when dealing with a serious diagnosis like ALS. ALS is not an easy disease to diagnose, and it’s been estimated that as many as 15% of ALS cases are misdiagnosed. Because ALS is a rather rare disease, many doctors have limited or no experience diagnosing ALS. When getting a second opinion, try to find a specialist who has experience working with ALS patients. Some clinics focus exclusively on serving ALS patients; you can click here to find the ALS clinic or center closest to you.</p>
    <p>Knowledge is power. The more you can learn about ALS — from its history to its vocabulary and current research — the better you’ll be able to make decisions regarding care, therapy, and planning. Joining a support group can help you deal with the emotional struggles that come with an ALS diagnosis. It also allows you to connect with and get advice from other people who have ALS, and who may have more experience with the disease.</p>
    <p>Though ALS currently has no cure, that doesn’t mean that there is no hope. In at least a few cases, people with ALS live for decades after their diagnosis. Some such patients find that the disease eventually stabilizes; though the symptoms they’ve experienced remain, no new symptoms develop. Regardless of how quickly the disease progresses, you still have much to live for and can make the most of the time you have.</p>
	<h2>Driving Challenges</h2>
    <p>For most people, driving provides independent mobility to commute to work, access to the community and travel. As teenagers, most people anticipate the opportunity to master the skills required to drive an automobile. However, few adults give much thought to assessing their ability to safely operate a vehicle.</p>
    <p>Advancing age, illness, and medications can impair one's ability to drive. For those diagnosed with ALS, progressive loss of motor function resulting in weakness and decreased reaction times eventually take its toll. Minor cognitive changes, such as having to "think twice" about a process or taking extra time to evaluate a familiar situation can lead to decreased ability to drive safely.</p>
    <p>Progressive loss of muscle control can occur so slowly the person doesn't recognize the change. Comments from family members or other drivers' comments may be the first indication that a person's driving performance is deteriorating. Broaching the subject of safe driving can be challenging for family members; the loss of independence afforded by driving is one of the most significant events a person can face.</p>
	<p>Those facing progressive loss of motor function or cognitive challenges can take proactive action by regularly asking their physician or occupational therapist to evaluate the potential impact of symptoms on their driving skills. Any occupational therapists can provide basic screening for driving safety.</p>
	<p>The ALS Association affiliates offer assessments through clinics such as the Duke University ALS Certified Treatment Center of Excellence, where Francesa Monchino, O.T.R./L., M.ED, M.O.T., regularly provides driver screening evaluations, which include assessing abilities related to cognition, strength, stamina and flexibility. In addition, people can be referred to a Driving Rehabilitation Specialists. Comprehensive evaluations can also include detailed measurement of braking time, neck movement, endurance and cognitive abilities. Screenings or evaluations can result in recommended changes to allow continued safe driving, referrals for community mobility access, or recommendations to discontinue driving in the face of overt safety challenges.</p>
	<p>A neutral authority figure outside of the family, such a physician can initiate the discussion related to increased risk associated with driving and highlight the value of a transition plan for safe community mobility. Occupational therapist Melissa Uhl, O.T.R./L., O.T.D. shares that many driving evaluations result in a proactive plan to access safe alternate transportation methods. A plan may include a steering wheel knob or hand controls, using alternate sources for transportation such as family and friends, or community transportation. Many communities provide alternate transportation services through an office of disability, special needs, or Agency on Aging.</p>
	<p>While technology continues to provide equipment to maintain quality of life in many arenas, it is clear that addressing the challenging issue of driving will require team effort.

	<h2>How to Share your ALS Diagnosis</h2>
	<p>Hearing from your doctor that you’ve been diagnosed with ALS is difficult. Telling those you love about your diagnosis can be almost as hard. When do you tell them? How do you tell them? What should you say? </p>
	<p>You’re in control of when you tell people about your ALS diagnosis. Many psychologists recommend that you wait until after you’ve come to terms with the diagnosis and feel emotionally ready to tell others. However, waiting also has its downsides. Close family members will surely notice something is wrong, even if they don’t know what it is. They may feel hurt when they later learn that you’ve been hiding something from them. Plus, the support you receive from close friends and family is important from the start. So, there are key people in your life that you’ll want to tell almost immediately. For others, you’ll want to wait and have a strategy in place before sharing the details of your situation. </p>
    <p>The details you share will differ depending on the person and their relationship to you. But there are a few basic points you should probably include:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>You’ve been diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, which is a motor neuron disease that affects voluntary muscle movement.</li>
	  <li>ALS is not contagious.</li>
      <li>The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms will become more severe and more noticeable over time.</li>
      <li>ALS affects everyone differently, so there is no way to predict how quickly it will progress or what muscle groups it will affect.</li>
      <li>There is currently no cure for the disease.</li>
      <li>Though ALS may change you physically and affect your ability to walk or talk, you’re still the exact same person inside.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Telling parents, especially elderly parents who may be in poor health, is another common concern for newly diagnosed people with ALS. Some experts recommend telling elderly parents in stages, to reduce the immediate shock. You can initially tell them that you have some medical symptoms that you’re checking with a doctor about. A little later, you can explain that the tests found something, but that you’re getting a second opinion. Eventually, you can fill them in on all the details.</p>
    <p>Telling people at work may require some research and planning, as ALS can affect your ability to continue doing your job. There may be questions about what accommodations your employer must provide to help you keep working, if that is your goal. You’ll probably want to talk with your doctor or other people you trust first, and know both your plan and your rights before bringing up your ALS diagnosis with your employer.</p>
	<h2>Discussing ALS with Children</h2>
	<p>As parents, grandparents or family caregivers, we naturally want to provide the children with a happy life and shield them from confusing, sad or painful experiences. One of the cruel facts about ALS is the profound impact this disease will have on the entire family.</p>
	<p>Few tasks can be more difficult or heart-wrenching than discussing the effects ALS will have on a parent or family member. Although many children may have experienced temporary illness or even disability issues within the family, what makes a discussion about ALS particularly challenging is the progressive nature of the symptoms.</p>
	<p>Obviously, learning that a parent has ALS can be very hard on children. Depression is not uncommon, and kids may benefit from counseling to help them cope. Some kids want to help, and playing a role (however small) in providing your care can help them feel needed and useful.</p>
	<p>Children of almost any age are quite perceptive of changes in family dynamics. Left without information, they may arrive at inaccurate conclusions, such as "Mom doesn't love us anymore," or "I must have done something to cause this." Make sure the child understands that he or she is in no way responsible for what is happening to their loved one.</p>
	<p>Successful communication involves providing children with honest, age-appropriate information. The child should know that even though ALS symptoms will progress, there are tools, equipment and healthcare providers who can help address challenges experienced by their loved one. Lori Banker-Homer, BA, LPN Care Services Director with The ALS Association Wisconsin Chapter shares the importance of meeting the child where they are developmentally and emotionally, rather than overwhelming them with information. Banker-Homer suggests "valuable opportunities for ALS-related conversations may present themselves while engaged in other activities, such as art projects or sharing a meal."</p>
	<p>Reassure children they will always be cared for by someone who loves them. For example; since Mom can no longer drive, Grandma will pick them up from school each day. Your own positive attitude will help children be more accepting of changes at home, such as the installation of a new ramp, which makes it safer for Dad to go between the house and car in his wheelchair.</p>
	<p>Allow children to share their feelings in their own way. A young child may take changes or challenges at "face value," not recognizing the progressive nature of ALS, and quickly return to their previous activities. School-age children with access to the Internet may investigate the disease online. Older teens may  have the ability to think through how current changes in the family may impact their near and long-term future. Acknowledge that not all questions have immediate answers but volunteer to help them seek out information.</p>  
	<p>Allow children to see how you are impacted by ALS. Understanding that you are sad that Dad can no longer drive or eat the same foods at the dinner table, can help children more easily relate to the situation. Sometimes, a simple hug and a positive statement can help turn a sad feeling to a more promising thought. You may say, "Now that Dad has a feeding tube, we don't have to worry about him getting enough to eat and the potential of him choking."</p>
	<p>Children often carry the impact of the home environment into the classroom. Sally Dwyer, Director of Programs & Services with The ALS Association Mid-America Chapter and eleven year veteran of elementary education, indicates children's behavior or academic performance may be affected by serious family illness. Dwyer highlights the value of sharing an ALS diagnosis, including the progressive losses experienced, with teachers stating, "Teachers are available to assist in supporting students and can help navigate positive experiences in the classroom." Alternately, some children feel school is one place that seems consistent, and they look forward to their familiar role as a student or classmate.</p>
	<p>Child psychology experts tell us that the key to effective communication with children is to provide information in a clear, consistent manner. It is important to:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Tell the truth, but keep it simple and age appropriate.</li>
	  <li>Make sure the child understands that it's not their fault.</li>
	  <li>Reassure the child that someone who loves them will always be there to take care of them.</li>
	  <li>Model a positive attitude by focusing on current quality of life aspects.</li>
	  <li>Allow children to share their thoughts and feelings, acknowledging your own appropriate emotions.</li>
	  <li>Communicate the challenges of progressive loss in ALS with teachers or coaches in the child's life.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Although each family will develop their own strategy for discussing ALS, many resources are available to assist with general or specific communication approaches. Challenges related to the introduction of hospice care, transitions that involve life after a loved one has died, or moving into a new home are topics often discussed with professionals such as faith-based advisors or hospice social workers. Of course, your local ALS Association chapter is there to help your family navigate the ALS journey.</p>
