    <h2>Research Accomplishments Since teh ALS Ice Bucket Challenge</h2>
    <p>The Association awarded nearly $90 million toward research grants around the world, in addition to funding for clinical care centers and advocacy initiatives.</p>
	<p>In 2018, the Association committed to an $18 million research budget. By comparison, the Association's research grants totaled $6.6 million in 2013 and $3.9 million in 2012, which illustrates the sharp trajectory of the Association's research investments after the Challenge.</p>
    <p>Between 2014 and 2018, the Association awarded over 300 grants to over 200 different scientists for ALS research.</p>
    <p>The number of ALS researchers funded through the Challenge grew from 42 in 2014 to 237 grantees in 2018.</p>
    <p>Grantees reported that their Association funding accelerated their research productivity and enabled them to form collaborations with not only other researchers but also clinicians and people living with ALS.</p>
    <p>The number of journal articles authored by the Association's research grantees and co-authorships between grantees both increased markedly between 2014 and 2018. Publications signal advancements in knowledge, and co-authorships reflect transmission of knowledge that may help accelerate science in the ALS field.</p>
    <p>National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding among the Association's research grantees increased between 2014 and 2018, mirroring the upward trajectory of donations to the Association and its subsequent research investments.</p>
    <ul><li>Leverage IBC dollar example: From our Researcher IBC Survey (out of 101 survey respondents), funded researchers reported receiving $40M from the Association, which contributed to $124M in follow-up funding from the NIH and other funding agencies.</li></ul>
    <p>Association-funded researchers identified five new genes that contribute to ALS, including KIF5A, C21orf2, NEK1, TBK1, and TUBA4A.</p>
    <p>The Association funding helped develop The Neuro Collaborative, which developed new "antisense" drug therapies that target two common ALS genes and are being tested in clinical trials, as well as several trials for drug therapies.</p>
    <p>In The ALS Association's history, we have committed over $147 million to research.</p>
	<h2>In 2018:</h2>
    <p>Committed an $18 million research budget to support promising projects all over the globe.</p>
	<p>Funded over 61 projects in 9 countries in new awards.</p>
    <p>The ALS Association continues to be a global leader in advancing ALS research. With the generous support of our donors, we are currently funding more than 108 active ALS research projects in 13 countries (as of Feb. 2019).</p>
    <p>Funded five new bright, young scientists through our Milton Safenowitz Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and one new clinician scientist through fellowship awards in partnership with the American Academy of Neurology</p>
	<h2>The ALS Association Global Research Program</h2>
	<p>The ALS Association awards various research projects throughout the year as part of its competitive grant portfolio, which includes the following grant programs:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Multi-year Investigator-Initiated Awards:</b> To established researchers for multi-year projects.</li>
	  <ul><li>$100,000 year for 3 years = $300,000 total award</li></ul>
      <li><b>Starter Awards:</b> To researchers new to the ALS field or senior postdoctoral fellows/young scientists establishing their own independent labs.</li>
	  <ul><li>$50,000/year for 1 year = $50,000 total award</li></ul>
	  <li><b>Milton Safenowitz Postdoctoral Fellowship:</b> To establish and facilitate promising young scientists to enter the ALS field. Postdoctoral fellows must be in their fellowship for less than 2 years. Fellows work with a senior mentor and receive extensive exposure to the ALS research community through meetings and presentations.</li>
	  <ul><li>$50,000/year for 2 years = $100,000 total award</li></ul>
	  <li><b>Managing ALS Award:</b> To improve the lives of people with ALS, and their families and caregivers. The research will advance our understanding and the quality of ALS management in the United States, including assistive technology, quality and affordability of services and treatments, and documenting and alleviating ALS burdens.</li>
	  <ul><li>$100,000/year for 2 years = $200,000 total award</li></ul>
      <li><b>Lawrence and Isabel Barnett Drug Development Award:</b> Fosters collaborations with companies/academia to fund milestone-driven research focused on preclinical studies to move treatment approaches closer to clinical trials.</li>
	  <ul><li>$250,000/year for 2 years = $500,000 total award</li></ul>
	  <li><b>Strategic Initiatives:</b> Researchers submit collaborative projects that address research gaps, areas of high risk-high reward, and/or areas that provide novel opportunities.</li>
	  <ul><li>Award amounts vary - Refer to research toolkit to learn what we have funded in this category (section 1.1.4 - Our Strategic Initiatives)</li></ul>
	  <li><b>Clinical Trials:</b> To support up to and including phase II clinical trials that are associated with a comprehensive biomarker program to test novel, high-potential treatment approaches in people with ALS.</li>
	  <ul><li>Award amounts vary based on the application need - applicants can request up to $1.5 million per trial</li></ul>
	</ul>
	<p>The Association is the largest private funder of ALS research worldwide and funds the most promising research projects on a global scale. Our efforts have led to some of the most innovative and significant advances in ALS research.</p>
	<p>All studies funded through our organization undergo a competitive review based on NIH standards. Leading experts from around the world take part in the grant program review process to select the most promising ALS projects. The Association's grant review process is rigorous, following policies and procedures that are in place to maintain the utmost integrity of the research program. Members of the Association's Research Committee provide oversight for the final approval of the grant award, and the Board of Trustees gives the final approval.</p>
	<p>The ALS Association, as a funder in a disease without a cure, believes that the more researchers collaborate and share information, the faster they will arrive at effective treatments and a cure. The Association encourages open access publications, pre-registered protocols, and open data sharing whenever possible. The Association also values collaboration whenever possible to encourage partnerships to prevent duplication and promote innovation.</p>
