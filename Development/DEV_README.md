# Development Branch
## Reporting errors
If you see an error in the code, you can either fix the error and push to the origin, or if you want other's advice on the error, you can create a new issue under the issues tab. You can assign people to this issue.
## Making changes
Changes can be made at will to code in this branch. 
## Pushing to prod
Make sure all changes made are clean code and work well before pushing changes to the prod branch. Do not break the prod build!
