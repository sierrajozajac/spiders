# Spiders GitHub
## Intro
Our project involves creating a website for the ALS Association that embodies the ALS Bootcamp event. We hope to include information on the disease, devices available, support available, and more on this website. 
## Development Branch
This branch is used for making changes that have not yet been seen by the team. Once these changes are viewed and accepted by the team, the changes can be made to the same files that exist in the prod branch. We use this folder to test new changes without fear of breaking the build.
## Production Branch
This branch is used to publish the website. Changes made in the dev branch should be well tested before they get moved to the prod branch as it is less consequential if the build breaks on the dev branch. Hopefully, our prod branch build will never be broken.
