# Production Branch
## The build
The build refers to the final wrapped up product of our website. If any code is broken, then the build is broken. It is fine for the dev branch build to be broken, but it is not okay for the prod branch build to be broken. The build is hosted onto a server for public users to browse.
## Broken build
If the build becomes broken, then we should rollback to the last working build. This includes undoing whatever changes broke the build.
